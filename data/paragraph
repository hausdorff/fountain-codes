Abstract

   This specification defines a lossless compressed data format that
   compresses data using a combination of the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman
   coding, with efficiency comparable to the best currently available
   general-purpose compression methods.  The data can be produced or
   consumed, even for an arbitrarily long sequentially presented input
   data stream, using only an a priori bounded amount of intermediate
   storage.  The format can be implemented readily in a manner not
   covered by patents.
